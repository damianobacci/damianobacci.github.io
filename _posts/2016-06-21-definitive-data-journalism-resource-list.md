Through my research on the web, I stumble upon a lot of resources like tools, websites and tutorials. I'm already covering books [in another post](https://damianobacci.github.io/blog/data-journalism-books-must-read), so I thought it would be interesting to collect all the other stuff here. I don't want to use a Google Doc or a service like [Delicious](http://del.icio.us/), so I'll put everything here. I hope you will find it useful, if you have something interesting to add drop me a comment!
