Through my research on the web, I stumble upon a lot of resources like **tools**, **websites** and **tutorials**. I'm already covering books [in another post](https://damianobacci.github.io/blog/data-journalism-books-must-read), I thought it would be interesting to collect *all the other stuff* here. I don't want to use a Google Doc or a service like [Delicious](http://del.icio.us/), so I'll put everything here. I hope you will find it useful, if you have something interesting to add drop me a comment!

Since I strive to be *more international* every time I can, I also post content in **other languages**.
