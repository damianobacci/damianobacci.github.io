[**AlboPop**](http://albopop.it/) is a small experiment created by [**Andrea Borruso**](https://twitter.com/aborruso) and [**OpenDataSicilia**](http://opendatasicilia.it/), a group of **passionate professionals** whose mission is improving public community's awareness and quality of life through [**Open Data**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data) and [**Open Government**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_government).

### What is an *Albo Pretorio*?

In the Italian administrative system, an *albo pretorio* is a space where **public administrations** are obliged by law to publish all sorts of **news and notices of public interest** for the community.

The *Comune* is the Italian word for [**municipality**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipality), a single urban administrative division having **corporate status** and powers of **self-government or jurisdiction**, and in Italy it represents the smallest administrative power. All *Comuni* are required to have an *albo pretorio* where they can publish their notices. These notices can be **decrees, order, regulations, call for council meetings** and many different public announcements concerning the local community.

You can think of the *albo pretorio* as a **public council noticeboard**, and I think that a comparable example (albeit more limited) with the UK reality could be the [modern.gov app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.moderngov.modgov&feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDEsInVrLmNvLm1vZGVybmdvdi5tb2Rnb3YiXQ)

The *albo pretorio* is an **important way** for the citizen to be **aware** and **engaged** about all the choices and process of the public administration: it's a precise stream of informations and data that it's **vital** for citizens. Unfortunately it's not so easy to have a proper access to these informations, and this is **harming our power to be informed** and **made correct decisions**.

### Albo Pretorio Online

All municipalities are required to have a link to the *albo pretorio* right on their homepage:

**Problems** arise when you try to get **updates** on all the notices that are getting published every day (four or five per day): in the majority of *albi pretori* there is **no way in doing that**. That's because there is **no standard** for the platform of an online *albo pretorio*, so every municipality can potentially get a different system to manage it. Since every system works in a different way you can find yourself dealing with multiple way of **organizing data, filtering and sorting it,** etc...

For example, here are others *albi pretori* from Narni's nearby *Comuni*:

As you can see, pretty much every *Comune* has a **different method** of managing its *albo pretorio*. Worst than that, there is **no way to get updates** when there is a new publication. Imagine being a citizen that wants to **monitor public choices, contracts** and so on: you are obliged to go to the website **every day** just to check if there are updates, and if you are not 100% committed you will probably lose interest during time.

**AlboPop** is a way to overcome this situation. It will make "**popular**" the *albo pretorio* by **integrating its feed in the social networks** that you utilizes the most.

### How AlboPop is done

### Known Problems

Of course nothing can be really safe forever when you are talking about **public administrations** and **computers**:
