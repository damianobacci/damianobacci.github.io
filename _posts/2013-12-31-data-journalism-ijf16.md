The [International Journalism Festival](http://www.journalismfestival.com) (**IJF**) is a journalism festival held in [Perugia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perugia) every year, with a moltitude of panel discussions, workshops and presentations done by over [500 speakers](http://www.journalismfestival.com/speaker-list/2016). In the 2016 edition I had the chance to volunteer at the festival, and so I was able to attend many sessions devoted to data journalism topics. Here's a list of what I found interesting.

First of all, I have to tell you that you can view all past events of IJF **for free** on [**its Youtube channel**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClUtH75j6Bd7_Ty17jHVDPg). Unfortunately there is **no translation available**, this means that even if there was a translation during the event you can only listen to the original audio. I hope they'll fix this problem in the future.

This year the festival was packed with data journalism events, I think it was the first time in which I was obliged to choose between two simultaneous panels that interested me. A lot of them were done by the amazing [**Dataninja**](http://www.dataninja.it/), an independent team of journalists and tech people focusing on **data journalism**, **visualizations**, **open data** and **geo data**. I had the opportunity to meet them and I can assure you about their passion and their knowledge. Other amazing workshops were done by [**Marco TÃºlio Pires**](https://twitter.com/mtrpires), manager of the [**School of Data**](http://schoolofdata.org/). Not only they were very **interesting and useful**, but Marco has an **amazing knack for teaching**, I hope you will check them out.

Let's dive in!
