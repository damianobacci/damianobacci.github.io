The [International Journalism Festival](http://www.journalismfestival.com) (**IJF**) is a journalism festival held in [Perugia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perugia) every year, with a moltitude of panel discussions, workshops and presentations done by over [500 speakers](http://www.journalismfestival.com/speaker-list/2016). In the 2016 edition I had the chance to volunteer at the festival, and so I was able to attend many sessions devoted to data journalism topics. Here's a list of what I found interesting.

First of all, I have to tell you that you can view all past events of IJF **for free** on [**its Youtube channel**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClUtH75j6Bd7_Ty17jHVDPg). Unfortunately there is **no translation available**, this means that even if there was a translation during the event you can only listen to the original audio. I hope they'll fix this problem in the future.

This year the festival was packed with data journalism events, I think it was the first time in which I was obliged to choose between two simultaneous panels that interested me. A lot of them were done by the amazing [**Dataninja**](http://www.dataninja.it/), an independent team of journalists and tech people focusing on **data journalism**, **visualizations**, **open data** and **geo data**. I had the opportunity to meet them and I can assure you about their passion and their knowledge. Other amazing workshops were done by [**Marco Túlio Pires**](https://twitter.com/mtrpires), manager of the [**School of Data**](http://schoolofdata.org/). Not only they were very **interesting and useful**, but Marco has an **amazing knack for teaching**, I hope you will check them out.

Let's dive in!

### [Tools for the collection, organization and analysis of data](http://www.journalismfestival.com/programme/2016/tools-for-the-collection-organization-and-analysis-of-data) ([slides available](http://slides.com/dataninja/tool-raccolta-analisi-dati#/))

**Who**: [Andrea Nelson Mauro](https://twitter.com/nelsonmau), [Gianluca De Martino](https://twitter.com/glucademartino)

**What**: Andrea opens the panel with a brief introduction about Dataninja and their past works, including the elearning platform [**Dataninja School**](http://school.dataninja.it/). Gianluca then talks about different scraping tools like [**Tabula**](http://tabula.technology/) and [**ScraperWiki**](https://scraperwiki.com/), and Andrea demonstrates how to use the [**Scraper** extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/scraper/mbigbapnjcgaffohmbkdlecaccepngjd) for Google Chrome. The resulting spreadsheet is then put on **Google Spreadsheets**, filtered and analyzed using a [**pivot table**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pivot_table). They proceed to talk about [**OpenRefine**](http://openrefine.org/) and how it can be used to clean your data.

**What**: This session focus on using [**Python**](https://www.python.org/) to work with your spreadsheets data, an additional tutorial is available on [the relevent repository](https://github.com/mtrpires/pyPerugia16) on [Marco's GitHub page](https://github.com/mtrpires). A little knowledge of Python and [**regular expressions**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) is required, make sure to check [this course](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-7) on **edX** about computer science and Python.
