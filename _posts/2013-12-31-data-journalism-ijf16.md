The [International Journalism Festival](http://www.journalismfestival.com) (**IJF**) is a journalism festival held in [Perugia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perugia) every year, with a moltitude of panel discussions, workshops and presentations done by over [500 speakers](http://www.journalismfestival.com/speaker-list/2016). In the 2016 edition I had the chance to volunteer at the festival, and so I was able to attend many sessions devoted to data journalism topics. Here's a list of what I found interesting.

First of all, I have to tell you that you can view all the past events of IJF for free on [its Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClUtH75j6Bd7_Ty17jHVDPg). Unfortunately there is no translation available, this means that even if there was a translation during the event you can only listen to the original audio. I hope they'll fix this problem in the future.

This year the festival was packed with data journalism events, I think it was the first time in which I was obliged to choose between two simultaneous panels that interested me.
