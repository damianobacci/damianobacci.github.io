Last month I was able to have a look on a survey who was taken by the [**Embassy of Italy in the United Kingdom**](http://www.conslondra.esteri.it/consolato_londra/it/) among various Italian academics residing in the UK.

Unfortunately the picture that it's coming out from this survey is a little bit scaring, at least for the future of the country and many of its residents.

The **negative effects** of Brexit are looming on the UK, and negotiations still have an aura of **terrible outcome**, judging from the interests at stake. British and EU officials met Monday in Brussels to discuss, and everyone was quick to roast the British delegation:

There are [multiple areas](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2017/jul/20/where-are-we-up-to-in-these-brexit-talks) that are key to the negotiations, regarding both [economics](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jul/20/eu-calls-on-uk-to-urgently-make-offer-on-divorce-bill?utm_content=buffer1a3c6&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer) and social issues. The **climate of indecision** already got bankers on the move, either to [Dublin](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/29/ireland-says-dozen-london-based-banks-to-relocate-to-dublin-over-brexit?CMP=share_btn_fb&utm_content=buffere4162&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer) or [Frankfurt](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-17/citigroup-said-to-choose-frankfurt-as-new-european-trading-hub?utm_content=buffer730bf&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer), [Paris, Amsterdam](http://bruegel.org/2017/02/brexit-and-the-european-financial-system-mapping-markets-players-and-jobs/).

The **pharmacheutical industry** could also [follow them fast](http://bruegel.org/2017/05/pharmaceutical-industry-at-risk-from-brexit/):

> Moreover, a UK outside of the EU might find it difficult to attracted skilled experts for the industry, lose research funding supported by the EU, and face barriers accessing the EU27 market. For the rest of the EU, Brexit could also cause similar additional costs on the whole, but given its larger economic size than the UK, the loss would also be smaller. For some EU countries, if they can seize the opportunity to take on UK business, or become the new location for the EMA, there is a chance to benefit despite the general loss in the EU.

Amidst all these negativity it's easy to imagine the academic sector in a similar situation: this is what is coming out from the survey of the **Impact of Brexit on Italian academics working in the UK**.

To get a little bit of context, the Higher Education Statistics Agency ([HESA](https://www.hesa.ac.uk/data-and-analysis/staff)) has various statistics about the employment of the academic staff in British University.
