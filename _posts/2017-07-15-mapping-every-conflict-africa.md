The **ACLED** (Armed Conflict Location and Data Event Project) is a project directed by Professor Clionadh Raleigh of the University of Sussex whose mission is to map every conflict event in Africa and South East Asia.

This is a fantastic dataset that it's publicly available [here](http://www.acleddata.com/data/). You can feel that there is a huge number of stories about *struggle*, *death* and *conflicts* hidden between all those lines. It has been a big source for personal projects about Africa, and an invaluable piece of data that can help us understand what is going on through the entire continent.

I tried to visualize here all the conflicts based on the number of fatalities on [CARTO](https://carto.com).

There are many things that **I don't like** with this visualization, that mainly come from my poor understanding of the platform, or its limits (I can't really judge).

* the size of the circle should be proportional to the number of casualties
* there should be different colours for the different type of conflicts

My plan is to build a lot of stories that can use this dataset (and a similar one of the [**Uppsala Conflict Data Program**](http://ucdp.uu.se/))
