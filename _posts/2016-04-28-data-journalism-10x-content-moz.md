Are SEO and good journalism made of the same principles? Random thoughts about data journalism and 10X content.

<!--more-->

As I approach **the end** of my master's degree, I realized that I studied a broad spectrum of things during these years. I chose my degree to focus on **traditional journalism** (my models were incredible people like [**Ryszard Kapuściński**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryszard_Kapu%C5%9Bci%C5%84ski), [**Anna Politkovskaya**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Politkovskaya) and [**Indro Montanelli**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indro_Montanelli)) but I found myself really interested into other forms of journalism like **data journalism** (as this blog may have suggested to you), or even totally different subjects, like **social media management**, **digital marketing** and **web development**. What I thought was a **weakness** (focusing on too many things instead of a single one) may have ended up being **positive** for my career. 

But let's not digress too much: with my interest in [**SEO**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization) growing and thanks to the help of my good friend [Monokoma](http://www.wearecomplicated.net/), who is a freelancer web developer and SEO consultant, I began to study on sites like [**Backlinko**](http://backlinko.com/), [**Search Engine Land**](http://searchengineland.com/) and of course the greatest of all: [**Moz**](https://moz.com/blog).

Moz started as a search marketing blog and now provides its clients with one of the most powerful SEO tools available on the market. [**Rand Fishkin**](https://moz.com/about/team/randfish) was the CEO of Moz between 2007 and 2013 and he has this amazing weekly feature called [*Whiteboard Friday*](https://moz.com/blog/category/whiteboard-friday) in which he picks a topic and discuss it in details.

*Why am I telling you this?*
