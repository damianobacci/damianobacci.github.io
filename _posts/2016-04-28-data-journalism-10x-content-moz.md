Are SEO and good journalism made of the same principles? Random thoughts about data journalism and 10X content.

<!--more-->

As I approach **the end** of my master's degree, I realized that I studied a broad spectrum of things during these years. I chose my degree to focus on **traditional journalism** (my models were incredible people like [**Ryszard Kapuściński**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryszard_Kapu%C5%9Bci%C5%84ski), [**Anna Politkovskaya**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Politkovskaya) and [**Indro Montanelli**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indro_Montanelli)) but I found myself really interested into other forms of journalism like **data journalism** (as this blog may have suggested to you), or even totally different subjects, like **social media management**, **digital marketing** and **web development**. 

But let's not digress too much: with my interest in [**SEO**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization) growing and thanks to the help of my good friend [Monokoma](http://www.wearecomplicated.net/), who is a freelancer web developer and SEO consultant, I began to study on sites like [**Backlinko**](http://backlinko.com/), [**Search Engine Land**](http://searchengineland.com/) and of course the greatest of all: [**Moz**](https://moz.com/blog). 

## Moz and Rand Fishkin

Moz started as a search marketing blog and now provides its clients with one of the most powerful SEO tools available on the market. [**Rand Fishkin**](https://moz.com/about/team/randfish) was Moz's CEO between 2007 and 2013 and he has this amazing weekly feature called [*Whiteboard Friday*](https://moz.com/blog/category/whiteboard-friday) in which he picks a topic and discuss it in details.

*Why am I telling you all this stuff?*

Because Rand recently made [an episode about *10X content*](https://moz.com/blog/how-to-create-10x-content-whiteboard-friday)

## 10X Content

The ideas behind 10X contents are really worth sharing:

> * It has to have **great UI and UX** on any device.
* That content is generally a combination of **high quality**, **trustworthy**, it's **useful**, **interesting**, and **remarkable**. It doesn't have to be all of those but some combination of them.
* It's got to be **considerably different** in **scope** and in **detail** from other works that are serving the same visitor or user intent.
* It's got to create an **emotional response**. I want to feel *awe*. I want to feel *surprise*. I want to feel *joy*, *anticipation*, or *admiration* for that piece of content in order for it to be considered 10x.
* It has to **solve a problem or answer a question** by providing that comprehensive, accurate, exceptional information or resources.
* It's got to deliver content in a unique, remarkable, typically unexpectedly pleasurable style or medium.

Rand actually shared [a Google Doc file](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z2CSidq-6fxOY1YJLu-MY-DdTqWKiSL4gsuSGVC42r0/edit) with a list of 10X content. What stands out? **`Most of them are incredible data journalism pieces!`{:.yelhglt}** We have [The Upshot on the NYT](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/05/28/upshot/you-draw-it-how-family-income-affects-childrens-college-chances.html?_r=0), [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/war-and-peace-before-1945/), [some](http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-pace-of-social-change/) [grapich stuff](http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-whats-warming-the-world/) [from Blooomberg](http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/), [a collection of articles from The Atlantic](http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/05/slightly-more-than-100-fantastic-pieces-of-journalism/284564/). We also have longform articles on [the NYT](http://www.nytimes.com/projects/2012/snow-fall/#/?part=tunnel-creek), [Maptia](https://maptia.com/anuarpatjane/stories/in-search-of-whales) and [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/12/the-dark-side-of-guardian-comments). I invite you to take a look of all these amazing works and explore the different way of reporting.

That striked me out: Rand is basically teaching us **how to create better contents for our readers**, especially Internet users who expect a tremendous quality in return for their time. If you want to *really* stand out in the world today, it's not required only to write decent stuff, but you have to really dig down on the subject, presenting informations graphically in a mobile-first environment, answering all questions.

It's not a matter of *old school vs new style of reporting*: we have to **cover the hell out of a story**, using every possible tool at our disposal to enhance the experience and overall comprension for readers.

Just look at this [beautiful example](http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/may/26/firestorm-bushfire-dunalley-holmes-family) from the Guardian: **text, audio, visual information and video** are **brilliantly put together** to create an immersive reporting experience. There are of course many questions with this type of reporting: is it too **time-consuming**? Can it effectively **engage the readers**? And if someone doesn't have the technical capabilities to achieve it?

The matter remains open, but right now I'm pretty much sure that this is what we have to strive for. Just remember all the questions that Rand told you to ask yourself:

> * What **questions** are being **asked** and **answered** by these search results?
* What sort of **user experience** is provided? I look at this in terms of *speed*, in terms of *mobile friendliness*, in terms of *rendering*, in terms of *layout* and *design quality*, in terms of *what's required from the user to be able to get the information*? Is it all right there, or do I need to click? Am I having trouble finding things?
* What's the **detail and thoroughness of the information** that's actually provided? Is it lacking? Is it great?
* What about use of **visuals**? Visual content can often take best in class all the way up to 10x if it's done right. So I might check out the use of visuals.
* **`The quality of the writing`{:.yelhglt}**.
* I'm going to look at **information and data elements**. Where are they pulling from? **What are their sources**? **What's the quality of that stuff**? What types of information is there? **What types of information is missing**?

Turns out that **they can help us to be better journalists**, if we focus on the **extreme quality** of our writing and how can we make the readers **more informed** on a specific topic. With the *transparency on data* and *methodology* that comes with data journalism, as data journalists we may be better prepared for the future of our job.
