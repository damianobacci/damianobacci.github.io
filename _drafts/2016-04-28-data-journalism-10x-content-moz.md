Are SEO and good journalism made of the same principles? Random thoughts about data journalism and 10X content.

<!--more-->

As I approach **the end** of my master's degree, I realized that I studied a broad spectrum of things during these years. I chose my degree to focus on **traditional journalism** (my models were incredible people like [**Ryszard Kapuściński**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryszard_Kapu%C5%9Bci%C5%84ski), [**Anna Politkovskaya**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Politkovskaya) and [**Indro Montanelli**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indro_Montanelli)) but I found myself really interested into other forms of journalism like **data journalism** (as this blog may have suggested to you), or even totally different subjects, like **social media management**, **digital marketing** and **web development**. What I thought was a **weakness** (focusing on too many things instead of a single one) may have ended up being **positive** for my career. 

But let's not digress too much: with my interest in [**SEO**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization) growing and thanks to the help of my good friend [Monokoma](http://www.wearecomplicated.net/), who is a freelancer web developer and SEO consultant, I began to study on sites like [**Backlinko**](http://backlinko.com/), [**Search Engine Land**](http://searchengineland.com/) and of course the greatest of all: [**Moz**](https://moz.com/blog). 

## Moz and Rand Fishkin

Moz started as a search marketing blog and now provides its clients with one of the most powerful SEO tools available on the market. [**Rand Fishkin**](https://moz.com/about/team/randfish) was Moz's CEO between 2007 and 2013 and he has this amazing weekly feature called [*Whiteboard Friday*](https://moz.com/blog/category/whiteboard-friday) in which he picks a topic and discuss it in details.

*Why am I telling you all this stuff?*

Because Rand recently made [an episode about *10X content*](https://moz.com/blog/how-to-create-10x-content-whiteboard-friday):

<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe class='wistia_embed' name='wistia_embed' src='http://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/5zlnmyulwr' allowtransparency='true' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='480' height='298'></iframe></div>

## 10X Content

> * It has to have great UI and UX on any device.
* That content is generally a combination of high quality, trustworthy, it's useful, interesting, and remarkable. It doesn't have to be all of those but some combination of them.
* It's got to be considerably different in scope and in detail from other works that are serving the same visitor or user intent.
* It's got to create an emotional response. I want to feel awe. I want to feel surprise. I want to feel joy, anticipation, or admiration for that piece of content in order for it to be considered 10x.
* It has to solve a problem or answer a question by providing that comprehensive, accurate, exceptional information or resources.
* It's got to deliver content in a unique, remarkable, typically unexpectedly pleasurable style or medium.
